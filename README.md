# CIS-106-Spencer-Lempinen

## Assignment 1

I am attending Harper to earn my associate in science (Comp Sci). I was encouraged by my counselor to take this class to make sure I get a good feel for what I will be getting myself into and make sure that this is something that I want to spend the next 3 years studying. I am hoping with taking this class I will learn some of the basics of coding and logic that way I can understand the field that I want to enter. Even in just creating this GITHUB account and learning how to use the repository and create a folder I am already intimidated, but I am very eager to understand.

## Assignment 2

Through Reading Chapter 1 I was intrigued by Python mainly due to Its Readability. Through some other research online it seems that Python has a very clean syntax and is fairly readable compared to other languages.After looking online I want to be able to create a interactive Mad Lib program and maybe even a Text based adventure game. I tried Visual Studio by Microsoft and Pycharm by Jetbrains. I believe Pycharm is going to be my IDE of choice. Its user interface seems friendly and I found it to be less intimidating than visual studio's. Initially I thought visual Studio would be better only becuase it is a Microsoft program but for this class I belive Pycharm will be the better option. Jetbrains Pycharm also has a autocomplete syntax feature which seems to help me avoid errors and in the future, it could help save time.

## Assignment 3

Upon completion of Activity 7, which entailed converting a dog's age in "human years" to the equivalent in "dog years," I gained a significant understanding of several key concepts. One of the key takeaways was the importance of adhering to the correct order of operations when constructing a program. Initially, I encountered several errors in my flowchart due to improper declaration and assignment of variables. Additionally, I learned the significance of proper formatting for output, as a lack of attention in this area can lead to spacing errors for end-users. The successful completion of the program filled me with a sense of accomplishment and an eagerness to tackle more complex projects, such as utilizing "if" statements. Overall, this was a very fun activity.

## Assignment 4

I learned several concepts from this activity. I gained more experience using input/output operators. I also became more familiar with storing values as floats and as integers. after realizing that my program would not run if someone were to put a decimal as an input i realized i need to go back and store the inputs as floats and not integers. Finally one of the most important things i learned from doing this assignment was using logic anf control flow. getting a better grasp on those two concepts really helped me understand what things to tackle first and how to proceed in a logical manner.
