# CIS-106-Spencer-Lempinen

## Assignment 1

I am attending Harper to earn my associate in science (Comp Sci). I was encouraged by my counselor to take this class to make sure I get a good feel for what I will be getting myself into and make sure that this is something that I want to spend the next 3 years studying. I am hoping with taking this class I will learn some of the basics of coding and logic that way I can understand the field that I want to enter. Even in just creating this GITHUB account and learning how to use the repository and create a folder I am already intimidated, but I am very eager to understand.

## Assignment 2

Through Reading Chapter 1 I was intrigued by Python mainly due to Its Readability. Through some other research online it seems that Python has a very clean syntax and is fairly readable compared to other languages.After looking online I want to be able to create a interactive Mad Lib program and maybe even a Text based adventure game. I tried Visual Studio by Microsoft and Pycharm by Jetbrains. I believe Pycharm is going to be my IDE of choice. Its user interface seems friendly and I found it to be less intimidating than visual studio's. Initially I thought visual Studio would be better only becuase it is a Microsoft program but for this class I belive Pycharm will be the better option. Jetbrains Pycharm also has a autocomplete syntax feature which seems to help me avoid errors and in the future, it could help save time.

## Assignment 3

Upon completion of Activity 7, which entailed converting a dog's age in "human years" to the equivalent in "dog years," I gained a significant understanding of several key concepts. One of the key takeaways was the importance of adhering to the correct order of operations when constructing a program. Initially, I encountered several errors in my flowchart due to improper declaration and assignment of variables. Additionally, I learned the significance of proper formatting for output, as a lack of attention in this area can lead to spacing errors for end-users. The successful completion of the program filled me with a sense of accomplishment and an eagerness to tackle more complex projects, such as utilizing "if" statements. Overall, this was a very fun activity.

## Assignment 4

I learned several important concepts from writing this program in Python. Firstly, I gained more experience using input/output operations and became familiar with storing values as both floats and integers. I realized the importance of storing inputs as floats, as it allows for decimal values to be used. One of the most significant lessons I learned from this assignment was the importance of using logic and control flow in programming. Having a solid understanding of these concepts helped me to approach the problem in a logical and systematic manner, which was essential for writing a successful program. Overall, this activity was a valuable learning experience that has helped me to deepen my undertanding and hopefully will help me apply this to personal projects like creating a text based adventure game and more importantly implementing these skills in a professional setting.

## Assignment 5

In this assignment, I was tasked with focusing on functions. I used the same activity as in Assignment 4 (Monthly, Weekly, Annual Pay Calculator) but I had to create input, output, and calculation functions. This was far more difficult for me than I had expected. I have been working with Python a lot and I seemed to understand how to define functions and use them to call variables into the main program. Flowgorithm really forced me to pay attention to the order in which I was using the functions and making sure I was labeling all of my variables both inside and outside the functions in a way that would be readable to someone else. I found this activity to give me a good feeling of accomplishment. I can see how this would be very useful in a professional setting. Functions can be reused throughout the program, which makes for a shorter amount of code needing to be written and I feel that this would also help organize the code and improve the readability of the entire program.
