# CIS-106-Spencer-Lempinen

## Assignment 1

I am attending harper to earn my associate in science (Comp Sci). I was encouraged by my counselor to take this class to make sure I get a good feel for what I will be getting myself into and make sure that this is something that I want to spend the next 3 years studying. I am hoping with taking this class I will learn some of the basics of coding and logic that way I can understand the field that I want to enter. Even in just creating this GITHUB account and learning how to use the repository and create a folder I am already intimidated, but I am very eager to understand.
